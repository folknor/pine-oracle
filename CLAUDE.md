## More rules

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Always get permission** from the user before launching subagents.

**Do NOT use git worktree isolation for parallel agents.** Worktrees create merge conflicts that silently drop agent work. Instead, launch agents in the same tree with strict file ownership - zero overlap.

Agent coordination rules:
- Each agent gets exclusive ownership of specific files. No two agents touch the same file.
- Agents must read their target file FIRST. Do not replace existing code with placeholders or stub it out.
- Agents must NOT run `brokkr` or `cargo`. The orchestrator validates between agents.

Audit protocol:
- Do not trust agent claims of completion. Verify existence + wiring + behavior.
- Use the 3-pass audit structure: domain-specific verification, then cross-cutting reconciliation (does the new instruction actually dispatch? is the new builtin actually installed?), then editorial normalization.
- Any discrepancies doc should contain only current gaps, not historical records. Remove resolved items entirely.

Subagent prompt rules:
- Scope the investigation, not the report. Caps like "under 1500 chars" or "max 15 findings" throw away signal you asked them to surface.
- Invite lateral findings up front. If they notice a bug, optimization, smell, or anything surprising while doing the scoped work, they should flag it, even when it's outside the immediate task.

### Memory rules

Do not use your Memory functionality. Do not read, write, or update memories. Do not suggest saving things to memory. Durable context belongs in CLAUDE.md or the relevant docs.

### Bash rules

All Bash rules live in AGENTS.md under "Bash rules". CLAUDE.md imports AGENTS.md via `@AGENTS.md`, so those rules apply here too. Do not add Bash rules here; extend the list in AGENTS.md.

### git commit rules

- Always run `brokkr fmt` before a commit.
- Never commit markdown changes alone. Bundle them with upcoming code commits.
- When committing other changes: always tag along markdown files if dirty.
- Write substantive engineering-focused commit messages.
- Has `Cargo.lock` changed? Commit it.
- Never `git push` unless the user explicitly asks. Stop after the commit.
